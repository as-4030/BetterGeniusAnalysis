### Genius Lyric Scraper â™«

This is a full-stack application I made using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL. 
I created a REST API with CRUD capabilities and linked it to an Angular frontend. MySQL is also in action, holding onto important JSON data. The API generates the JSON (via a script I personally made) and stores it in a MySQL database).

I am still working on this project. Features that I'll add in the nearby future are charts from generated JSON data, the ability to search titles directly instead of using links (would require work with the Genius API), and the ability to grab JSON data from entire albums.

Here is the link:

Here is a video demonstration of how the site works, just in case it is down for any reason:
